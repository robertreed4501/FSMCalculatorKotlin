# FSMCalculatorKotlin

<p>
    Text based calculator that can take any amount of operands and add/subtract/multiply/divide with proper order of operations.
    Uses State Machine design pattern, inheritance, and polymorphism to read in an arithmetic expression string and build a stack of CalcObjects, then perform operations on the operands in proper order.
    Built as a take home project for a job interview in two days, had no previous experience in state machine design pattern or Kotlin, but it sure was fun.
